# Temperature

## 1.Introduction

![](images/Weather.jpg)

In this section, we will delve into the historical temperature data of Singapore, aiming to gain a thorough insight through the creation of various interactive tools. Additionally, we will employ statistical tests and visualization techniques to substantiate the claim depicted in the charts—that there has been a temperature increase of 0.25 degrees per decade.

## 3. Data Preparation

### 3.1 About the Data

We aggregate monthly observations from 2013 to 2023, sourced from five distinct weather stations strategically located across Singapore's geographic regions. This process involves the meticulous integration of data sets to represent a comprehensive view of Singapore's climatic conditions over the specified period. This aggregated data set is already created for our group project.

### 3.2 Put Data into R environment

```{r}
weatherdata <- read_rds("data/weatherdata.rds")
summary(weatherdata)
```

### 3.3 Data Wrangling

We will develop multiple sub-tables to perform the analysis

```{r}
annual_avg_temp <- weatherdata %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(AnnualAverageMeanTemp = mean(MeanTemp, na.rm = TRUE))

monthly_avg_temp <- weatherdata %>%
  group_by(Year,Month) %>%
  summarise(AnnualAverageMeanTemp = mean(MeanTemp, na.rm = TRUE))
monthly_avg_temp$Month <- factor(monthly_avg_temp$Month,
                                  levels = 1:12,
                                  labels = 
              c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "June", "July", "Aug","Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"),
                                  ordered = TRUE)

Daily_avg_temp <- weatherdata %>%
  group_by(Year,Month,Day) %>%
  summarise(AnnualAverageMeanTemp = mean(MeanTemp, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## 4.Exploratory Data Analysis

### 4.1 interactive plot: Annual Average Temperature by Station

```{r}
annual_avg_temp_bystation <- weatherdata %>%
  group_by(Year,Station) %>%
  summarise(AnnualAverageMeanTemp = mean(MeanTemp, na.rm = TRUE))

plot_ly(data = annual_avg_temp_bystation, 
        x = ~Year, 
        y = ~AnnualAverageMeanTemp, 
        color = ~Station)
```

Observation: Over the past decade, Changi Station, situated in the East Region, has recorded higher temperatures compared to other regions.

### 4.2 Historical Temperature Comparison By Stations

```{r}
monthly_avg_temp_bystation <- weatherdata %>%
  group_by(Year,Month,Station) %>%
  summarise(AnnualAverageMeanTemp = mean(MeanTemp, na.rm = TRUE))
monthly_avg_temp_bystation$Month <- factor(monthly_avg_temp_bystation$Month,
                                  levels = 1:12,
                                  labels = 
              c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "June", "July", "Aug","Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"),
                                  ordered = TRUE)

gg <- ggplot(monthly_avg_temp_bystation , 
       aes(x = Month, 
           y = AnnualAverageMeanTemp,
           size = AnnualAverageMeanTemp,
           color = as.factor(Station)
           )) +
  geom_point(aes(size = AnnualAverageMeanTemp,frame=Year),
             alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  labs(x = 'Month', 
       y = 'Daily Mean Temp') + 
  theme(legend.position='bottom') +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Year", 
                             override.aes = list(size = 3),
                             ncol = 1))
ggplotly(gg)
```

Observation: The same result can be obtained as 4.1, over the past decade, Changi Station has recorded higher temperatures compared to other regions.

### 4.3 Box plot: Annual Temperature Comparison

::: panel-tabset
## Daily Mean Temp

```{r}
ggplot(weatherdata, aes(x = Year, y = MeanTemp)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", notch = TRUE) + labs(title = "Aunnul Mean Temperature by time serie", x = "Year", y = "Annual Mean Temp") + theme_minimal()
```

## Daily Max Temp

```{r}
ggplot(weatherdata, aes(x = Year, y = MaxTemp)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", notch = TRUE) + labs(title = "Aunnul Max Temperature by time serie", x = "Year", y = "Annual Max Temp") + theme_minimal()
```

## Daily Min Temp

```{r}
ggplot(weatherdata, aes(x = Year, y = MinTemp)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", notch = TRUE) + labs(title = "Aunnul Min Temperature by time serie", x = "Year", y = "Annual Min Temp") + theme_minimal()
```
:::

Observation: Upon analyzing the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures over the past decade, no definitive trend of increasing temperatures emerges. Further, more detailed examinations will be carried out to substantiate this observation.

### 4.4 HeatMap: Mean Temperature by Year and Month

```{r}
ggplot(monthly_avg_temp, 
       aes(Year, 
           Month, 
           fill = AnnualAverageMeanTemp)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "white", 
          size = 0.1) + 
  theme_tufte(base_family = "Helvetica") + 
  coord_equal() +
  scale_fill_gradient(name = "# of attacks",
                    low = "sky blue", 
                    high = "dark blue") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, 
     title = "Heat Map of Temeperature by Year& Month") +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )
```

Observation: Analyzing the heat map, there's no definitive indication of a rising temperature trend over the past decades. However, it is observable that Singapore experiences its warmest months from April through October.

### 4.5 Monthly Average Temperature Trends by Year

```{r}
ggplot(monthly_avg_temp, aes(x = factor(Month), y = AnnualAverageMeanTemp, group = Year, color = factor(Year))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Monthly Average Temperature Trends by Year", x = "Month", y = "Average Temperature")
```

Observation: Adopting this method allows for a clearer perspective on Singapore's temperature trends. By analyzing the data in this manner, we can independently verify the finding that Singapore's warmest months span from April to October, paralleling insights obtained from heat map visualizations.

## 5 Confirmatory Data Analysis

### 5.1: Trend Analysis of Temperature

Since in the visualization part, we can not detect any specific trend of temperature from past decade. We will perform a trend analysis to examine whether there is a general trend in the temperature data over these years, indicating global warming or any other significant climatic change

```{r}
model <- lm(AnnualAverageMeanTemp ~ as.numeric(Year), data = annual_avg_temp)
summary(model)
```

```{r}
ggplot(annual_avg_temp, aes(x = as.numeric(Year), y = AnnualAverageMeanTemp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Long-term Temperature Trend", x = "Year", y = "Average Temperature")
```

Based on this analysis, there doesn't appear to be a significant trend in the annual average mean temperature over the years in your data set. The changes in temperature from year to year are not statistically significant, suggesting that the temperature has remained relatively stable over the period under consideration, at least within the sensitivity of this model.

At the same time, the slope of the line is -0.004621, indicating that the temperature decreases by approximately 0.0046 units for each additional year. However, this is a very small change and may not be practically significant.

We can infer that relying solely on temperature data from the past decade to predict future temperatures will likely not result in an increase of 1.4 to 4.6 degrees, as previously suggested by the chart.

## 6.Design of R Shiny

![](images/R shiny design 2.png) The proposed dashboard for Singapore's weather analysis will include 3 main sections:

-   Exploratory

-   Confirmatory

-   Prediction

This interactive user interface will feature drop-down menus for each categories: Temperature, Rainfall, and Wind. A slider will also be included to offer users an option to drag from 2013-2023 for a time-frame selection. Lastly, a location option will be implemented with choices from the five main regions in Singapore: Central Region, North Region, North-East Region, East Region and West Region, based on the station that was chosen respectively: Newton, Admiralty, Pulau Ubin, Changi, Jurong (West).

Under exploratory analysis, the dashboard will provide a boxplot, dynamic line, bar charts, and heatmaps which will change according to what users choose as a filter to manipulate what is shown on the screen. These descriptive visualizations will provide information through the display of trends throughout the years for selected regions. Additional features include interaction capabilities, such as zoom features and tooltips. For all the graphs, it will correspond to all the categories for this section since they will be under the same format. Confirmatory and predictive modeling will be similar, with different graphs such as a test for confirmatory, and a forecast for prediction purposes.
